Desturu is an absolute nerd. That aside, you can trust and count on him. Whether you need help with robbing a bank, solving gay math, back-up to fight off an army of 4th graders, an invitation to watch the Lion King, or someone to question your wardrobe choices. He’s funny, kind, and will be truthful with you. A book worth reading cover to cover (because if you haven’t read every word, you haven’t read the book). I also suspect he might one day become a real-life super villain.</span>
