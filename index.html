That's one-quarter of a century that you've lived, so congrats on that. I know you don't like birthdays and celebrating them, but this is a little present I prepared for you. I wanted to do something for your birthday, but I wasn't really sure what, so I stuck with what I know best. So, here's something that you may not know. I consider myself to be the unofficial movie critic and things of this nature... So, I decided to make this gay ass one-page website for you, with this gay ass message. And that's that on that, sis. <img src="./images/tea1.png" /><img src="./images/tea2.png" /> Don't be fucking rude, and enjoy it.</div>

Desturu is an absolute nerd. That aside, you can trust and count on him. Whether you need help with robbing a bank, solving gay math, back-up to fight off an army of 4th graders, an invitation to watch the Lion King, or someone to question your wardrobe choices. He’s funny, kind, and will be truthful with you. A book worth reading cover to cover (because if you haven’t read every word, you haven’t read the book). I also suspect he might one day become a real-life super villain.</span>
